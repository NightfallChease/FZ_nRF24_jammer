## âœ¨ Newly Added Features

  - Added a new submenu for custom jamming profiles: PS4, PS5, Xbox, Switch, Wireless Audio, and AirPods/Pro.
  - Each profile jams on the correct frequencies/protocols for the target device.
  - BLE-based devices (PS4, PS5, AirPods/Pro) use BLE jamming logic (channels 2, 26, 80).
  - Proprietary devices (Xbox, Switch, Wireless Audio) use constant carrier jamming on their respective channels.

  - Enhanced submenu and jamming screen navigation to prevent getting stuck.
  - BACK button always exits submenus and jamming screens as expected.
